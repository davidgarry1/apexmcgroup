              An old Chinese proverb reflects our reality well, “The only thing constant about change is change itself.” As factors including contexts, global and local conditions, and client and constituent demands change, the most effective solutions identified will be in need of strategic and tactical realignments in order to remain targeted and effective. A sustained reflective and synergistic process of progressive problem solving leading to measurement and realignment for value adding is, therefore, not only important, but essential for staying on the path to apex.<br><br>

              Our team at SYNERGY MCG has learned that effectively solving a problem requires a targeted and accurate identification of the issues and problems to be addressed. Understanding the real issues and problems allows for the strategic generation of potential solution options. Selection of the optimal strategic options pursuant to cost/benefit and risk management analysis for each option will allow for organizational alignment and implementation. Fostering passion with the stakeholders for the newly Aligned strategy will then provide the synergy and the path for performance optimization and striving for excellence.
